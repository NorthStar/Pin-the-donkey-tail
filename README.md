Games with donkeys and pinterest

This is a game motivated by pinterest users. Right now it allows a pinterest member play games with a donkey image searched through pinterest so they are readily repinned. 

Play
====================
Slide the tiles to play.


Future Plan
====================
Integrating pinterest pins with images used.
We plan on cropping the images by position and record scores as a user plays.
Idea
====================
Our idea is that Pinterest users are especially interested in repinning cute and pretty pictures. Meanwhile, the social part of pinterest is mainly based on organization of boards. This app tries to make a game out of pinned boards primarily through the images. Donkeys are cute and they are silly, so if a pinner loses a game, her/his pinboard will have a donkey added to it.(Or perhaps the other way around- we have not decided!) In this way, Pinterst users can have more fun exploring the internet through their pinned items and from other pinners.


Technicality
====================
The pinIt buttons are made available through the iOS embedded framework from pinterest.
Query searches are made availble through PT.h and PTClient.h.
